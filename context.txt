IPG Mediabrands strengthens Greater China collaboration with dual leadership promotions

China – IPG Mediabrands has elevated two of its senior leaders to key regional roles, appointing Penny Chow as chief operating officer for Greater China and Jay Lee as executive creative director of MBCS Greater China.

The dual promotion is part of the company’s efforts to strengthen collaboration across its three offices in the Greater China region and support a more integrated craft-led structure.

Chow was most recently managing director of IPG Mediabrands Taiwan and MBCS Hong Kong. With over 20 years of experience in the advertising industry, she joined IPG Mediabrands in 2017 to launch MBCS in Hong Kong, where she led partnerships with brands including Nike, Coca-Cola, and Disney. In 2022, she was appointed to lead the Taiwan office, where she played a key role in growing its client portfolio, which now includes Dyson and American Express.

In her expanded role as COO, Chow will oversee business operations in Hong Kong SAR—including both MBCS and the media team—while continuing to lead the Taiwan office. She will be based in Taiwan and report to Melinda Po, CEO of IPG Mediabrands Greater China.

Lee, previously executive creative director of MBCS Hong Kong, has more than two decades of experience across creative disciplines, having worked on accounts such as Samsung, McDonald’s, Volkswagen, and Hong Kong Airlines. He joined the company in 2017 and has since been known for his data-driven creative approach.

As executive creative director of MBCS Greater China, Lee will lead creative teams across mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan. He will be based in Hong Kong and report to Chow.

“The promotions for Penny and Jay are well-deserved. Both have demonstrated exceptional leadership in the past – with a grand vision, strategic insight, and relentless pursuit of excellence, not only individually but for the entire group,” Po said. 

“Empowered by Mediabrands’ craft-led model, centered around business leadership, strategy, design, investment, activation, analytics, operations and growth, Penny and Jay joining the Greater China Committee team will build a more unified and integrated organisation to optimise resources and bolster collaboration, driving greater growth for our clients,” she added.

JD Sports and adidas lead with local culture in their 'SMU campaign'

JD Sports fashion and adidas’ partnered for a nostalgic campaign driven by culture-first storytelling and a clear goal to connect with the region’s youth through an authentic lens. This campaign brought the story closer to home.

“Our insights highlighted the strong performance of localised campaigns in the region, consistently showing deeper consumer engagement and stronger results. This reinforced the importance of crafting a narrative rooted in local culture – something that feels familiar, authentic, and relevant to our audience,” said Eugene Karasev, adidas Senior Brand Director, EMC.

As a result of this approach Mehak Nanda, Brand Marketing Manager, GMG found that, “The campaign sparked a sense of nostalgia among younger audiences, even those who hadn’t grown up in Dubai, highlighting how shared cultural aesthetics across the Middle East can create emotional connections across generations.”

The campaign rollout spanned JD’s social platforms, META ads and in-store touchpoints, including digital screens and POSMs across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and Kuwait.

It targeted Gen Z and young adults (ages 13–30) in the UAE, especially those passionate about streetwear, sneaker culture, and lifestyle fashion, with a strong inclination toward brands that reflect their identity and environment. Many are digital natives who value authenticity over aspiration. The creative approach reflects that energy.


To bring the story to life, the team developed ‘The Neighbourhood’ – a fictional but familiar setting inspired by youth culture in the region. Shot in a heritage-style Dubai neighbourhood, the visuals capture raw textures and tones that feel culturally rooted and visually compelling. The storyline follows a local artist navigating the city in standout adidas sneakers, crossing paths with a cast of creatives who appear throughout. The campaign zeroes in on JD’s exclusive styles – known as SMUs.

“The narrative was shaped by the first-hand stories and lived experiences of third culture kids – those who grew up in old Dubai, spent time in its backstreets, and witnessed the city evolve around them. This was a passion project and a localised campaign launch fuelled by memory, community, and a genuine desire to portray the region in its truest form,” says Nanda.

Influencers were carefully selected for their connection to local communities and relevance within the adidas originals universe.

The campaign featured a mix of regional micro-influencers – from artists and athletes to fashion creatives – selected for their genuine ties to community and culture. The result was bold, energetic content that reflected the sneaker culture through the lens of music and sport as well as regional identity.

“Influencer marketing played a key role in the campaign. The cast featured a curated group of local micro-influencers – spanning music, fashion, and multisport – who are well-known within their communities. These talents were chosen not only to reflect adidas Originals’ deep ties to culture and creativity but also to ensure the campaign felt grounded in the region, bringing an added layer of authenticity and local relevance to the storytelling,” said Karasev.

“We handpicked a diverse mix of talent from the local community – it wasn’t about influencer reach but about authentically highlighting JD’s connection to music, fashion, and art in the region. We also created some fun behind-the-scenes content, styling reels, and location shoutouts (rolling out soon!) to further amplify the community-first message,” says Nanda.

At the same time, the partnership focused on converting that awareness into sales by creating demand through impactful, locally resonant storytelling. According to Karasev, the primary goal of the campaign was to drive awareness around adidas and JD exclusives, positioning them as must-have drops within the region.

“The campaign was driven by JD’s reputation for exclusive product offerings – known as SMUs – which are spotlighted through their signature ‘Only at JD’ callouts. These styles are central to JD’s global and regional success and consistently resonate with consumers, yet there’s often limited content to support them,” says Karasev.


“With both JD and adidas’ growing footprint in the Middle East, this partnership presented a timely opportunity to spotlight adidas SMUs through a fresh, localised lens. The goal was to craft premium, bespoke content that not only captures the essence of both brands but also speaks directly to our regional audience. By delivering an always-on content approach across our partner’s channels, the campaign reinforces the message of exclusivity while driving demand and differentiation in a highly competitive market,” said Karasev.

“Rooted in the streets of our region, it brings together adidas Originals’ spirit of individuality with JD’s ‘King of the Streets’ attitude,” says Nanda.

The campaign is currently live across all JD stores and will run until the end of June 2025. It was launched across JD’s social channels, META ads and in-store platforms, including POSMs and digital screens across key regional markets – UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and Kuwait.

“While the campaign is still live and the full report is in progress. We’re primarily tracking reach and sell-through as key performance indicators,” said Karasev.

As the market continues to demand deeper, more meaningful connections, this campaign suggests one thing loud and clear – when it comes to exclusivity, context is everything.

Zalando and adidas Spotlight Adizero EVO SL

Having become one of the most sought-after sneakers amongst running communities, the Adizero EVO SL now lands in a new adidas campaign on Zalando that explores the silhouette’s performance and style in places other than racetracks.

Set against Paris’ bustling cityscape with locals on the go, the visuals use the tapestry of modern-day life to showcase the running shoe’s all-around adaptability. Moving from cafés to flower shops and navigating busy streets in between, they are captured in parallel as they use the Adizero’s cutting-edge technology – in particular the Lighstrike Pro Foam – to keep up the momentum of their daily commutes in the city.

Helping to illustrate the story, an accompanying lookbook layers static images of the respective campaign stars with dynamic shots of runners in motion. The distinct contrast of these two communities is further highlighted by editorial styling, which places the hero duo in a wardrobe of athleisurewear pieces while runners are dressed in lightweight T-shirts and shorts. Though their style and speed remain different, each image shows how the running shoe can shift seamlessly between their worlds.

A New Vision for Performance Footwear

For years, the adidas Adizero line has earned its reputation as a top-tier option for runners chasing personal records. But with the latest campaign from adidas and Zalando, the Adizero EVO SL is no longer confined to marathon courses or starting blocks. Instead, it takes to the streets of Paris to show how performance technology can power everyday life.

Paris, with its mix of history, hustle, and creative energy, serves as the perfect backdrop for this campaign. The city’s vibrant character adds dimension to the Adizero EVO SL’s story—this is a shoe built to do more than clock miles. It’s designed for momentum, whether you’re dodging scooters in the 3rd arrondissement or dashing across a café-lined street to catch the Metro.


The Heart of the Campaign: Urban Utility Meets Athletic Edge

This campaign is less about the finish line and more about what happens between point A and point B. Through visuals layered with both motion and stillness, the story of the EVO SL unfolds across familiar scenes—grabbing flowers from a corner shop, weaving through sidewalk crowds, or catching a glimpse of yourself in a glass storefront. All of it in motion. All of it styled with intention.

While many running shoes remain purely technical in nature, the Adizero EVO SL bridges that divide. Its design is lightweight, aerodynamic, and packed with features that matter to serious runners—but its sleek silhouette and minimal colorway make it wearable beyond the gym or track. It’s athleisure with purpose, and that duality is at the heart of this new campaign.


Technology That Moves With You

A cornerstone of the Adizero EVO SL is adidas’ Lightstrike Pro Foam. Developed for maximum energy return and featherlight feel, this innovation offers responsiveness and support without the bulk. Whether running intervals or running late, the foam provides a consistent underfoot experience that adapts to pace and surface.

The outsole delivers grip on slick city sidewalks while staying flexible enough for quick pivots and turns. Combined with a breathable upper and sock-like fit, the EVO SL gives wearers the sensation of being dialed in—without being locked in to a single use case.

It’s this blend of utility and comfort that makes the EVO SL a standout in the performance sneaker space. And in this campaign, it’s that adaptability that gets the spotlight—not just what the shoe does, but what it allows wearers to do.


Style and Storytelling in Motion

The lookbook accompanying the campaign leans into visual storytelling. Juxtaposing high-energy action shots with editorial-style stills, adidas and Zalando bring together two distinct types of individuals: everyday Parisians navigating the chaos of their city and focused runners carving out their lane. Both groups, though different in tempo, rely on the same footwear to keep pace with their world.

On one side, there’s the effortless cool of a café regular, dressed in tapered joggers and a relaxed tee. On the other, a runner powering up Montmartre’s hills in lightweight shorts and a focused expression. The styling in each frame reflects the same point—regardless of outfit or agenda, the EVO SL slots right in.


A Celebration of Movement, Art, and Community

To mark the campaign’s launch, adidas and Zalando are planning an immersive event at Berlin’s Vollgutlager on June 26. The space, known for hosting forward-thinking creative experiences, will be transformed into a celebration of speed, light, and modern motion. From DJ sets to interactive installations, the event promises to blur the lines between art and athleticism.

The event aims not only to promote the new campaign, but to showcase how products like the EVO SL are shaping a new category: performance footwear that transitions effortlessly from exercise to expression. It’s not about dressing like a runner—it’s about running your day your way, with gear that keeps up.


From Track Star to Style Icon

As sneaker culture continues to evolve, the lines between functional and fashionable are becoming increasingly blurred. The adidas Adizero EVO SL fits right into that evolving landscape, proving that tech-heavy performance gear doesn’t have to live in a separate lane from personal style.

With this new campaign, adidas and Zalando challenge consumers to rethink how performance sneakers fit into their wardrobe. Whether you’re logging miles or making moves in the city, the EVO SL is designed to be there with you—ready for the sprint and the slow stroll, the early mornings and the late-night wanderings.
