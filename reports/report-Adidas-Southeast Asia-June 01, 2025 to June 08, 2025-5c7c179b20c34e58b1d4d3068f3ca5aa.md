### Competitor Traffic & Revenue Performance Analysis

This section provides an analysis of the traffic and revenue performance of Nike and its primary competitor Adidas across Southeast Asia during the period from June 01 to June 08, 2025. The primary focus will be on capturing the competitive landscape through a breakdown of key performance indicators (KPIs) contextualized within the prevailing market dynamics of the region.

#### Traffic & Revenue Performance Metrics

The analysis highlights key metrics that shed light on the intra-country performance across various divisions and categories for both Nike and Adidas:
- **Actual Revenue:** Revenue figures are detailed in local currency to reflect accurate financial performance within each market.
- **Revenue Growth (%):** Both brands are evaluated for revenue growth compared to the previous year or baseline metrics.
- **Visitor Metrics:** Insights into total pageviews, unique visitors, and conversion statistics are covered to understand engagement relative to revenue outcomes.
- **Buyers and Orders**: The number of active buyers and completed orders provides additional granularity to analyze conversion efficiencies.
- **Average Order Value (AOV) and Average Unit Retail (AUR):** These metrics are essential to assess purchasing patterns and product price positioning.
- **Share of Business (% SOB)**: Represents revenue contribution analysis, indicating market positioning by revenue share.

#### Summary of Year-Over-Year Changes 

A summary table to visualize year-over-year percentage changes is included. Key insights into traffic dynamics suggest that while Nike maintained a robust performance, Adidas demonstrated a resurgence in several key markets, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia. Color-coded formatting will highlight any significant shifts, such as green for positive growth and red for declines.

#### Individual Country Performance

- **Indonesia**: Nike remains the leader, with significant revenue growth attributed to enhanced digital engagement forks amidst increasing adoption of online shopping platforms. Adidas has notably increased its market share through targeted campaigns during local festivities.
