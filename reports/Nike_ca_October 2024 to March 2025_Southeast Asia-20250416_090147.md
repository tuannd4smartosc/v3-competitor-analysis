# 2. **Comprehensive Competitor Analysis**

## 2.1 Executive Summary
This report provides an in-depth competitor analysis focusing on Nike and Adidas in the Southeast Asian market between October 2024 and March 2025. During this period, Nike grappled with declining revenues and market share, whereas Adidas capitalized on retro-themed product lines and targeted local campaigns. Macro trends such as a growing athleisure segment and significant regional events (e.g., Lunar New Year 2025, ASEAN Championship) influenced consumer spending and promotional campaigns.

Key implications include:

- An intensified rivalry between Nike and Adidas, driven by evolving consumer preferences for both high-performance and fashion-centric sneakers.  
- Adidas’s strong revenue growth (7% globally in Q3 2024, with notable success in Southeast Asia) contrasted with Nike’s 10.4% drop in sales in the same timeframe (Insideretail.asia, 2024).  
- Local collaborations and limited-edition product releases in Southeast Asia played a pivotal role in accelerating Adidas’s brand momentum.

Nike, despite allocating considerable marketing resources (especially for the Paris 2024 Olympics), encountered operational challenges and increased competition from smaller, more innovative brands. The strategic focus on “fewer, bigger” campaigns indicates potential for growth, yet requires more localized adaptations to effectively counter Adidas’s agile approach.

## 2.2 Market Overview
Southeast Asia remains one of the fastest-growing markets for sports apparel and footwear, benefiting from rising disposable incomes, an expanding youth population, and growing fitness consciousness (Globenewswire.com, 2022). By 2025, revenue from sneakers alone in the region is estimated to reach approximately USD 2.0 billion, growing annually at around 5.90% (Statista.com, 2025). Consumers value products that fuse style and performance, with global brands gaining traction alongside an array of local and regional competitors.

Major events during October 2024 to March 2025 further influenced consumer behavior:

- ASEAN Championship (December 2024–January 2025): Stimulated interest in football merchandise, benefiting both Nike and Adidas.  
- Lunar New Year (February 2025): Encouraged higher seasonal spending, with many brands releasing festive-themed, limited-edition apparel and footwear.  
- Songkran Festival (April 2025, though preparations start in March): Sparked promotions of water-resistant gear and training programs in Thailand.

In addition, evolving e-commerce ecosystems (e.g., Lazada’s promotions and a surge in mobile shopping) offered more direct channels to consumers, intensifying competition and price wars.

## 2.3 Competitor Profiles

### 2.3.1 Nike

#### 2.3.1.1 Market Share, Product Lines & Pricing Strategies
By Q1 FY25 (ending August 31, 2024), Nike’s revenues fell by 10.4% globally, settling at USD 11.6 billion (Insideretail.asia, 2024). Southeast Asia was not immune to this decline, partly stemming from:

- A decline in direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales (down by 13%).  
- Intensified competition from Adidas, and emerging brands such as On and Hoka.  
- More products being sold at discount rates: from 19.4% in 2022 to 44% in early 2024 (Brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com, 2024).

Nike’s product lines center on performance-oriented footwear (e.g., Air Max, Zoom series, LeBron basketball shoes) and athleisure apparel. During the review period, premium models generally ranged between USD 150–250, although clearance sales offered significant discounts.

#### 2.3.1.2 Promotional Campaigns (October 2024 – March 2025)
Below is a consolidated overview of Nike’s key Southeast Asian campaigns:

#### 2.3.1.4 KPIs & Performance Metrics
Publicly available data remain limited, but industry benchmarks in SEA point to 2–3% CTR for successful digital campaigns. Nike’s ROI details are not publicly disclosed (Marketing-interactive.com). However, with an increased emphasis on the Nike App and DTC channels, there is potential for capturing first-party data and deeper consumer insights.

### 2.3.2 Adidas

#### 2.3.2.1 Market Share, Product Lines & Pricing Strategies
Adidas posted a global revenue increase of 7% in Q3 2024, reaching EUR 6.44 billion, with a 46.2% boost in operating profit (Insideretail.asia, 2024). The brand’s triumph was notable in Southeast Asia, where retro-style footwear like Samba and Gazelle captured consumer attention. An emphasis on discount offerings via JD Sports and other local retailers reached up to 50% off, appealing to cost-conscious but style-driven consumers (Blog.jdsports.com.sg, 2024).

## 2.5 Strategic Insights
1. **Local Collaborations & Cultural Resonance**: Adidas’s partnerships (e.g., with Thai celebrities, local café chains in Singapore) have shown that cultural affinity fosters stronger community ties, brand loyalty, and organic word-of-mouth.
2. **Digital Transformation & Online Sales**: Nike continues pivoting to DTC channels via its Nike App. However, Adidas’s success with online channels and integrated influencer campaigns suggests deeper local nuance is required for Nike.
3. **Retro vs. Innovative Positioning**: Adidas has harnessed nostalgia via Samba, Gazelle, and similar lines, capturing fashion-conscious consumers. Nike’s edge in performance technology (e.g., Air, Zoom) can still be a differentiator if effectively marketed.
4. **Event Marketing**: The ASEAN Championship, Lunar New Year, and music/fashion festivals offer prime windows for brand visibility. Adidas’s presence at diverse local events underscores an adaptive approach that Nike could emulate.

## 2.6 Impact Assessment
- **On Nike**: Adidas’s robust local marketing, discounters’ preference for carrying Adidas’s discounted stock, and consumer excitement around retro lines placed Nike under pressure. Declines in global market share (15.2% to 14.1%) reflect vulnerability (Ifcmiran.asia, 2025).  
- **On the Market**: Consumers benefited from intensified discounts and a broader product selection. Smaller athletic brands also found traction as Nike softened in key retailer channels (Kwsn.com, 2024).  
- **Risks & Opportunities**: While discounting may drive short-term sales, overuse can erode perceived brand value. Alternatively, targeted local tie-ins and new event sponsorships can reinvigorate brand prestige and loyalty.

## 2.7 Conclusion & Recommendations
Despite some setbacks, Nike retains a globally recognized brand, exceptional R&D capabilities, and a robust pipeline of high-performance products. Adidas’s success demonstrates how culturally aligned campaigns and a blend of retro plus new product launches resonate with Southeast Asian consumers. By refining its approach to localized marketing, boosting local influencer tie-ins, and carefully balancing premium positioning with strategic discounting, Nike can regain momentum and strengthen its market share.

**Recommended Strategic Actions for Nike**:
1. **Deepen Local Collaborations**: Sponsor regional sporting events (e.g., SEA Games, local football leagues) and partner with prominent Southeast Asian athletes or celebrities to drive brand affinity.
2. **Refine Digital Engagement**: Expand the Nike App’s personalized experiences, integrating local languages, region-specific push notifications, and exclusive product drops tied to cultural festivities.
3. **Sustain Premium Image While Managing Discounts**: Limit discount events to specific seasons (e.g., post-Chinese New Year stock clearance) to maintain brand prestige.
4. **Innovate in Retro-Futuristic Lines**: Explore bridging modern technology (e.g., Flyknit, VaporMax) with classic silhouettes in limited-edition runs to rival Adidas’s popular heritage lineups.
5. **Measure & Optimize**: Enhance data-gathering for thorough ROI tracking on campaigns. Track local market engagement metrics (CTR, conversions by region) and dynamically adapt investments.
