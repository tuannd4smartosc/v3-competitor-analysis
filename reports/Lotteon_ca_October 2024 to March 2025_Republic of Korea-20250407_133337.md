## 5. Strategic Insights

1. **Evolving Consumer Preferences**: Consumers increasingly seek convenience (fast shipping, broad product ranges) but also show a rising interest in experiential/luxury offerings.
2. **AI and Personalization**: Coupang’s operational excellence puts pressure on Lotteon to differentiate via technology. AI-based product recommendations can yield higher conversion rates.
3. **Cross-border E-commerce**: “Rocket Jikgu” from Coupang demonstrates a growing appetite for overseas products. Lotteon’s global brand ties (e.g., Lotte Duty Free) could be leveraged similarly.
4. **Platform Synergies**: SSG.com’s success in connecting offline to online (department stores, curated offerings) signals potential for Lotteon to cross-promote with Lotte affiliates, from cinema tickets to theme park passes.

---

## 6. Impact Assessment

### 6.1 Effects on Lotteon’s Market Position
- **Price Competition**: Coupang’s discount campaigns significantly reduce the switching barrier. Lotteon user retention may suffer if not matched.
- **Brand Elevation**: SSG.com’s premium brand partnerships overshadow Lotteon’s mid-range status. If Lotteon fails to attract similarly exclusive tie-ups, it risks brand dilution.
- **Logistics Benchmark**: Coupang’s advanced logistics heightens consumer expectations for rapid delivery. Lotteon’s scaled-back services (e.g., discontinuation of Baro Delivery in April 2024) could harm brand perception.

### 6.2 Future Market Changes
- **Continued Online Penetration**: E-commerce share will likely climb beyond 50%, intensifying digital competition.
- **International Competitors**: Platforms like AliExpress and Temu will continue to compete on price, shrinking local margins (Korea Times, 2024b).
- **Political Stability**: Periodic political upheavals may temporarily dampen consumer sentiment, but recovery is typically swift.

3. **Logistics Revitalization**  
   - Explore partial reinstatement of a “quick delivery” service or partner with third-party couriers to speed up shipping.

4. **Focus on Seasonal & Cultural Events**  
   - Build on the success of Seollal campaigns.  
   - Create tie-ins with major local events (e.g., baseball season with Lotte Giants merchandise, fashion-related promotions during Seoul Fashion Week).

5. **Refined Targeting & Customer Segmentation**  
   - Employ more granular segmentation to tailor promotions to age groups, interests, and purchase history.  
   - Emphasize loyalty-building with robust membership benefits that can compete with Coupang’s WOW membership.
