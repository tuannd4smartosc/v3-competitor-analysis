# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma in (Southeast Asia, January 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns, Marketing Activations, and Noteworthy Events (Jan 01 – Jun 08, 2025)

### Campaigns and Events

During the first half of 2025, Nike, Adidas, and Puma executed multiple initiatives in Southeast Asia. These activities encompassed product launches, seasonal discount campaigns, regional marketing activations, and sponsorship shifts.

**Nike** introduced its first brand app in early 2025, offering personalized content, exclusive offers, and membership rewards. The app was made available in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In Malaysia, from February 20 to March 1, Nike Unite KLIA held an exclusive *Nike Membership* promotion, granting an extra 40% discount on storewide purchases and a free gift for high-value transactions. Between May 5 and 11, Nike ran a mid-season sale in Singapore, providing an additional 30% discount on over 1,500 items for those who purchased at least two sale products. Additionally, on February 7, Nike ended its longstanding sponsorship deal with the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP), making headlines across Philippine sports media.

**Adidas** forged new opportunities in Southeast Asia. On January 13, 2025, Adidas announced a multi-year partnership with the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, leveraging the connection with PETRONAS—a major Malaysian sponsor—to raise brand visibility in the region. As part of a prominent sponsorship shift, Adidas became the official athletic wear provider for the Philippine national basketball teams on May 9, replacing Nike. Throughout March, April, and May, Adidas participated in various multi-brand warehouse and expo sales in Singapore. These events offered steep discounts on footwear, apparel, and accessories in partnership with local retailers.

**Puma** captured regional attention through a mix of new product campaigns and targeted discount drives. From January 10 to February 12, Puma Singapore staged a Chinese New Year Sale, granting an extra 35% off selected merchandise. Early in 2025, Puma Southeast Asia launched the “See The Run Like We Do” initiative, spotlighting everyday runners across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The campaign coincided with the debut of the Deviate NITRO 3 shoe and multiple running clubs designed to foster local community engagement. Puma’s broader “See the Game Like We Do” project emphasized performance innovations such as the FUTURE and ULTRA football boots, reinforcing the brand’s athletic credibility.

### Additional Strategic Insights

These campaigns largely reflect each brand’s broader regional and global alignment. Nike’s push towards enhanced app-based engagement underscores a trend toward robust loyalty ecosystems, with members gaining exclusive access to discounts and early product releases. Adidas’s new sponsorship of the Philippine national basketball teams signals a high-visibility approach to capturing local markets, particularly in areas with strong competitive sports traditions. Meanwhile, Puma’s community-oriented running campaigns and Chinese New Year promotions indicate a blend of culturally relevant activations and performance-based brand positioning.

Across all three brands, overlapping discount periods—such as early-year and mid-season sales—demonstrate aggressive pricing tactics designed to capture holiday-driven and event-driven consumer demand. In Singapore and Malaysia especially, the presence of multi-brand warehouse sales suggests a heightened battle for market share, with each label vying for consumer attention. Loyalty programs remain a critical driver; Nike’s membership perks, Adidas’s tiered point system, and Puma’s referral campaigns cater to local preferences for exclusive events, limited-edition product drops, and deeper discounts.
