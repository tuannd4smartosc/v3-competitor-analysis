### Introduction  
This section delves into the traffic and revenue performance analysis of Nike, Adidas, and Levi's within the Southeast Asian market during the specified period from May 31, 2025, to June 07, 2025.

Levi's, primarily recognized for its denim, reported 13.22 million visits to its website in March 2025, with a modest growth rate of 4.14% from the previous month. While not traditionally a direct competitor in the athletic space, its focus on casual wear has seen incremental growth in a sector increasingly dominated by athleisure trends.
