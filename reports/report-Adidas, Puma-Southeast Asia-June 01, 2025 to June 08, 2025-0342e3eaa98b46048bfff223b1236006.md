# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns, Marketing Activations, and Public Events (June 01–08, 2025)

### Overview
During the specified period (June 1 to June 8, 2025) in Southeast Asia, there are no reported or publicly announced campaigns, activations, or noteworthy events by Nike, Adidas, or Puma that overlap fully with these exact dates. The most recent promotions for all three brands concluded prior to June or are scheduled later in the month. Notable details include:

- **Nike**: Last reported promotions ended in May 2025 (e.g., a mid-season sale in Singapore through May 11, 2025). No public controversies or app launches specific to June 1–8 are documented. 
- **Adidas**: The most recent promotions also ended in May 2025. An upcoming 30% off sale is planned for June 22–25, 2025 in Singapore. No digital or social media activations were officially announced for the June 1–8 window.
- **Puma**: No active loyalty or discount campaigns were present in Southeast Asia during the stated period. Recent promotions ended in May 2025 (e.g., Puma Thailand’s discount campaign running until May 24, 2025).

As a result, no new product launches, discount initiatives, brand collaborations, in-store events, or public controversies have been documented for these three brands in Southeast Asia within the June 1–8, 2025 range. 

### Additional Strategic Insights
• **Regional Timing Variances**: Many promotions ended in May while upcoming “mid-year” or “6.6” style campaigns were not observed. Adidas, for instance, is slated to resume promotions from June 22, missing the June 1–8 window.
• **Brand Overlaps and Missed Opportunities**: None of the three brands visibly targeted the June 6 (6.6) date range in Southeast Asia, suggesting a possible missed opportunity or a shift in focus to late June promotions. 
• **Potential Loyalty Focus**: While Puma’s loyalty program (AdvoCAT) and Nike’s strong app presence continue in the background, no exclusive June membership campaigns were highlighted. Adidas’s next targeted discount is set for later in June, indicating a potential gap in early June marketing activity.
• **Country-Specific Observations**: There is no indication of individual cities or countries engaging in brand-specific events, nor any particularly aggressive pricing beyond May promotions.

### Observations
• Nike’s Vietnam performance shows strong YoY growth in both traffic (+11.4%) and revenue (+10.0%), indicating successful local marketing initiatives.  
• Adidas demonstrates robust gains in Malaysia, where YoY revenue grew by 9.1%, suggesting higher consumer engagement and product relevancy.  
• Puma has moderate growth patterns, though certain markets like the Philippines show a slight revenue decline, pointing to potential pricing or promotional adjustments needed.  
• Across key countries, conversion trends appear positively correlated with traffic gains for all three brands, underscoring the importance of continued digital optimization.
