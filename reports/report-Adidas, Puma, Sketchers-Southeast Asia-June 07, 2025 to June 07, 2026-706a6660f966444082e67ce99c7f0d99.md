# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma, Sketchers in (Southeast Asia, June 07, 2025 to June 07, 2026)



##Competitor Analysis: Nike vs. Adidas, Puma, and Skechers in Southeast Asia (June 07, 2025–June 07, 2026)

### Executive Summary

During the June 07, 2025 to June 07, 2026 period, Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Skechers have each pursued targeted expansion within Southeast Asia’s rapidly growing sportswear market. Strong digital adoption, influencer marketing, and localized promotions are noteworthy trends across these brands. While Nike retains a significant brand reputation and premium positioning, tariff impacts (particularly in Vietnam), rising competition from regional and Chinese brands, and evolving consumer demands are key challenges. Adidas displays strong sustainability commitments and deep local partnerships, Puma is focusing on community-centric campaigns and digital outreach, and Skechers leverages affordability, comfort, and youth-centric influencer engagements. For Nike, strategically balancing brand prestige with localized campaigns and price-sensitive offerings is critical for safeguarding market share and ROI.

Key strategic implications for Nike:

- **Diversify Manufacturing Footprint:** High tariffs on Vietnamese imports have driven up production costs. Shifting parts of the supply chain to other Southeast Asian countries can mitigate risk.
- **Local Brand Partnerships:** Collaborations with local influencers, sports bodies, and cultural icons will reinforce Nike’s regional foothold.
- **Inclusive Pricing Tiers:** Offering mid-range product lines without diluting the core premium image could help Nike reach broader segments.
- **Community Building:** Doubling down on community runs, youth clinics, and consumer engagement events can strengthen long-term brand loyalty.
