# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns Analysis: Nike vs Adidas (June 2025)

### Nike Campaigns
As of June 8, 2025, Nike has not launched any specific promotional campaigns in Southeast Asia during the week of June 1 to June 8, 2025. However, several notable events are scheduled around this period:

- **Father's Day Sale**: From June 1 to June 18, 2025, Nike is promoting a sale with discounts of up to 30% on select styles. While this event is highlighted primarily in the U.S., similar promotions may be applicable in Southeast Asian markets. 

- **Upcoming Product Launch**: The Nike Pegasus 41, featuring new foam technology, is set to be released later in June through Nike's online channels and physical retail partners. Specific regional availability details remain unconfirmed for Southeast Asia.

Despite the absence of immediate promotions, Nike is known for its focus on digital engagement, aiming to enhance consumer interaction through initiatives like the Nike App, which has recently launched in Southeast Asia to offer personalized content and user engagement.

### Adidas Campaigns
In contrast, Adidas has also reported no active promotional campaigns specifically for the period of June 1 to June 8, 2025, in Southeast Asia. Recent data indicates that Adidas's promotional activities have largely concluded before June:

- **adiClub Days**: Launched on April 23, 2025, in Singapore, offering exclusive member perks and giveaways. 
- **Limited Time Sale**: Held from May 1 to May 7, 2025, providing a 30% discount on select items, alongside an additional discount for adiClub members.

Adidas's next major event is the **Mid-Year Sale**, scheduled from June 20 to June 30, 2025, which will offer significant mark-downs across various categories globally. 

### Summary Table

In conclusion, while both Nike and Adidas have shifts in their promotional strategies focused on brand positioning, Nike's immediate engagement has revolved around sales and app launches, while Adidas is preparing for significant sales later in June. Regular monitoring of both brands' official channels is recommended for the most current information regarding their campaigns.
