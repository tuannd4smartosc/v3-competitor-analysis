# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas,New Balance,Puma in (Southeast Asia, June 07, 2025 to June 07, 2026)



##Executive Summary and Promotional Campaigns Analysis

### Executive Summary

During the period spanning June 07, 2025 to June 07, 2026, Nike and its principal competitors—Adidas, New Balance, and Puma—face heightened competition in Southeast Asia, driven by regional market expansion and evolving consumer preferences. Notably, Nike maintains a leading position in markets such as Singapore, where it commands a market share of roughly 35% in sportswear (1xmarketing.com, 2023). Nonetheless, aggressive expansion by other global players and emerging Chinese sportswear brands has intensified the competitive atmosphere (Kr-Asia, 2023).

• **Nike’s Market Positioning**: While Nike maintains substantial brand equity and extensive retail presence, strategic challenges include balancing lifestyle products with performance-focused items, as competitors like Hoka and On Running have attracted more serious runners (Forbes, 2024). The brand’s shift to a direct-to-consumer model also creates an opening for competitors to partner with local retailers.

• **Competitor Movements**: Adidas leverages local collaborations and sustainability initiatives (researchgate.net, 2023); Puma emphasizes youth-centric and digitally driven campaigns (about.puma.com, 2024); and New Balance focuses on comfort, understated design, and local event sponsorships (fitandvogue.com, 2024). Each brand localizes strategies through regional partnerships and culturally attuned marketing, creating robust competition on nearly every consumer touchpoint.

**Key Takeaways and Strategic Implications for Nike**:

- **Strengthen Running Segment**: Address the loss of market share in performance running by investing in product innovation and endorsements tailored to Southeast Asia’s diverse running communities.
- **Balance DTC and Retail Partnerships**: Maintain direct-to-consumer momentum without alienating local retail partners, who can provide additional brand reach in key Southeast Asian urban centers.
- **Cultural Relevance**: Collaborate with local influencers, designers, and national sports associations to boost brand resonance, particularly in emerging markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines.
- **Digital Engagement**: Optimize social media and e-commerce channels (e.g., TikTok, Shopee, Lazada) to target younger consumers, building interactive communities around health, wellness, and sports.
