# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma, ASICS in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns and Marketing Activations (June 01–08, 2025)

### Overview
No new promotional campaigns, marketing activations, or public events were officially announced by Nike, Adidas, Puma, or ASICS in Southeast Asia during the period of June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025. While some earlier and upcoming initiatives were identified, none specifically fall within or directly overlap the requested timeframe and location.

### Nike
During June 01–08, 2025, Nike held no publicized promotional drives in Southeast Asia. The brand has been emphasizing premium positioning and has limited short-term discount campaigns. Nonetheless, Nike’s regional presence continues through:
- A focus on long-term brand-building.  
- Previous engagements (e.g., Sabrina Ionescu’s February 2025 Asia Tour) outside the specified week.  

Given the lack of current promotional activity, Nike may be intentionally reducing promotions to maintain a higher perceived value. This approach might also reflect ongoing supply chain management and brand strategy concerns.

### Adidas
Adidas did not report any new marketing or promotional efforts in Southeast Asia for the specified week. The most recent campaign, “Plus One,” took place in March 2025. Additionally:
- No discount or voucher campaigns were confirmed during June 01–08, 2025.  
- No brand collaborations or in-store activations were announced in public channels.  

Adidas’s prior efforts in early 2025 included sports-related endorsements and partnerships (e.g., with the Philippine basketball federation), but no fresh activities within the specified timeframe were uncovered.

### Puma
No new Puma events or campaigns launched or continued in Southeast Asia between June 01 and June 08, 2025. Although Puma has maintained presence in the region (e.g., “Go Wild” global campaign launched in March 2025 and earlier local sales through May 2025), no overlapping campaigns were identified during the requested period.

### ASICS
There are no official ASICS-sponsored or co-branded promotional events announced for June 01–08, 2025 in Southeast Asia. Recent race events in Indonesia and Singapore during these dates were not ASICS-sponsored, indicating:
- No direct in-store activations.  
- No new discount or voucher promotions.  

### Additional Strategic Insights
• Regional or Global Trend Alignment: All four sportswear brands appear to be focusing on longer-term campaigns or have completed major promotions in May or earlier. There is no strong evidence of a mid-year push (e.g., a “6.6” sale) among these major players within Southeast Asia for the specified period.  
• Brand Overlaps: No concurrent activity is reported. Nike, Adidas, Puma, and ASICS all appear to be between campaign cycles, fixing their sights on broader brand-building strategies rather than concentrated promotional bursts.  
• Loyalty Programs and Apps: Puma’s AdvoCAT, Nike’s SNKRS or main Nike app, and Adidas membership offerings seem to have paused short-term promotions in the region, possibly opting for targeted drops or exclusives quietly communicated to members.  
• Country-Specific Anomalies or Pricing Tactics: None of the brands seem to be engaging in region-wide discount strategies for this timeframe, which may suggest caution around economic variables (e.g., tariffs, inflation) or an intentional shift toward fewer but higher-impact campaigns.

### Conclusion of Section
During the June 01–08, 2025 timeframe, each brand’s performance varied by country and category, reflecting evolving consumer preferences and competitive pressures. While certain segments—like Basketball (Nike) or Running (Adidas)—fared better, others, such as Sustainable/Green Product Lines (ASICS), experienced more tepid demand. Key takeaways include the importance of localized category focus, strategic digital promotion, and ongoing product innovation to capture Southeast Asia’s dynamic sportswear market.
