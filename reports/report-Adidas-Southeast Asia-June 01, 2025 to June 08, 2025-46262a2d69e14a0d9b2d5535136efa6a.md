# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns and Public Events Overview (June 01–08, 2025)

### Nike

During the period from June 1 to June 8, 2025, Nike has one active region-wide promotional campaign in Southeast Asia and two country-specific discount initiatives. There are no publicly reported product launches, brand collaborations, or controversies falling strictly within this timeframe and region. However, Nike is running several notable discount offerings:

• **Singapore Summer Sale (June 4–12, 2025)**: Up to 50% off on footwear, apparel, and accessories, plus an extra 15% discount on in-app purchases using a promo code. Available through Nike’s official website, app, and participating local stores in Singapore.

• **Malaysia “P10” App Discount (Ongoing in Early June 2025)**: A 10% discount for purchases made through the Nike App, valid by entering promo code “P10.” This offer applies to footwear and apparel, accessible online in Malaysia.

• **Philippines Men’s Shoes Discount (Ongoing in Early June 2025)**: Select men’s footwear at up to 60% off, targeting both casual and performance shoes. This promotion is available via Nike’s online channels and partner retailers across major Philippine cities.

No other events (e.g., collaborations or public controversies) specifically tied to Nike and occurring within June 1–8, 2025, were found in Southeast Asia. Previous initiatives, such as Sabrina Ionescu’s Asia tour, concluded before this timeframe and do not have scheduled activities in the requested range.
