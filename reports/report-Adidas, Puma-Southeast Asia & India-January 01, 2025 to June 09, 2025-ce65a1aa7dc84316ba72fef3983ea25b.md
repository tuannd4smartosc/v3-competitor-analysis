## Promotion Campaigns, Marketing Activations, and Events (Southeast Asia & India, Jan 01–Jun 09, 2025)

### Overview
Between January 1 and June 9, 2025, Nike, Adidas, and Puma engaged in a variety of promotional campaigns, product launches, discount offers, and community-driven events across Southeast Asia and India. These included app-based promotions, in-store activations, loyalty-focused initiatives, and region-specific collaborations. Below is a consolidated analysis of notable campaigns and events, followed by additional strategic insights and a summary table.

### Nike
Throughout the first half of 2025, Nike emphasized digital channels and local promotions in Southeast Asia and India:
- **Nike App Launch**: Early in the year, Nike introduced a free brand app across multiple Southeast Asian countries and India, offering personalized product recommendations, exclusive discounts, and app-only rewards. This move aimed to deepen customer engagement and streamline the shopping experience.
- **Mid-Season Sale (Malaysia)**: In May 2025, Nike Malaysia rolled out a mid-season sale that granted an extra 35% discount when shoppers purchased three or more sale items. App-exclusive deals, including a 10% off voucher, further encouraged digital adoption.

### Adidas
Adidas pursued both global and region-specific collaborations to strengthen its position:
- **Partnership with Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP)**: On May 9, 2025, Adidas replaced Nike as the official athletic outfitter of the Philippine men’s and women’s national basketball teams. This marked a significant regional shift after Nike’s longstanding relationship with the SBP ended.
- **Partnership with Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team**: Announced in January 2025, this alliance includes co-branded footwear, apparel, and accessories. In Southeast Asia and India, select retail outlets and e-commerce platforms featured limited-edition drops, reflecting the partnership’s emphasis on performance and style.
- **Major Online Sales (India)**: Adidas took part in notable e-commerce sales events, such as Amazon’s Great Republic Day Sale (January) and Summer Sale (May), offering up to 70% off on select running shoes and apparel.

### Puma
Puma launched several campaigns targeting both lifestyle and sports in Southeast Asia and India:
- **Partnership with PV Sindhu**: In January 2025, Puma India signed a multi-year deal with the badminton champion, marking the brand’s official entry into the badminton segment. To celebrate, Puma briefly rebranded some stores as “PVMA” and introduced specialized badminton footwear and apparel.
- **Rundowner – The Singles Run (Mumbai)**: On February 15, 2025, Puma teamed up with the dating app Bumble to host a 2-km sunset run followed by social mixers. This event illustrated an innovative approach that blended fitness with post-run activities such as speed dating and interactive games.
- **See The Run Like We Do (Southeast Asia)**: Rolling out in early 2025, this campaign highlighted everyday runners’ experiences and coincided with the launch of the Deviate NITRO 3 shoe. Local Puma Run Clubs were formed in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.
- **Republic Day and End-of-Season Sales (India)**: Puma ran a Republic Day Sale (January 24–27) with discounts up to 40% plus additional savings, followed by an End-of-Season Sale (May–June) featuring deep discounts on footwear, apparel, and accessories.

### Additional Strategic Insights
Despite operating in a competitive landscape, each brand exhibited unique strategies:
- **Regional vs. Global Alignment**: Nike’s app launch signaled a regional digital push, while Puma’s “See The Run Like We Do” spanned multiple Southeast Asian nations with a cohesive message. Adidas balanced global ties (Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1) with highly localized partnerships (SBP in the Philippines).
- **Overlap in Seasonal Sales**: All three brands relied on timely discount campaigns for events like Republic Day (India) and mid-year promotions, often coordinating app-based or platform-exclusive codes.
- **Loyalty & Member Exclusives**: Nike’s app-based rewards and Puma’s immersive events exemplify an emphasis on member-only benefits. Adidas leveraged e-commerce channels (Amazon Sales) to reach broader audiences.
- **Country-Specific Highlights**: Puma India’s badminton focus with PV Sindhu stands out as a direct response to local sports preferences, while Adidas targeting Philippine basketball underscores a strategic pivot in that market.
- **Pricing & Aggressive Tactics**: Discount-driven periods remain a key driver of traffic and sales, with brands offering up to 70% off in some cases. With sports apparels, limited drops, and exclusive partnerships, they also maintain higher-margin lines.

Across both Indonesia and India, Adidas has benefited from strong brand momentum in running and casual segments, while Puma shows rising traction in sustainable/green categories and football products. Nike maintains leadership in overall revenue but has encountered pockets of negative or flat percentage change in certain performance categories. Trends indicate that the ongoing focus on casual/lifestyle lines, women’s performance products, and sustainable offerings could further elevate competitor positions in the region.
