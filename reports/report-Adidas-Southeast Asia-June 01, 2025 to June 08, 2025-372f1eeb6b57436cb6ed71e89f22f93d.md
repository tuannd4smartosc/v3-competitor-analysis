# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns Analysis (June 01–June 08, 2025)

### Nike
During the specified period of June 1 to June 8, 2025, there were no publicly announced Nike promotion campaigns, product launches, or specialized events in Southeast Asia. According to available information, Nike did not schedule any marketing activities in the region within these exact dates. While the brand often observes a **Father’s Day Sale** (traditionally running from June 1 to June 18, offering up to 30% off select styles) and a **Semi-Annual Sale** (often held from June 15 to June 30, with discounts up to 50%), no official regional announcements confirmed these promotions during the requested timeframe.

Outside the date range, Nike’s other notable events include:
- The **After Dark Tour**, a global nighttime race series that concluded in Mexico City on June 21, 2025, without any Southeast Asian stops.
- Various footwear releases previewed in the SNKRS Showcase in December 2024, slated for regional launches throughout 2025.

### Adidas
Similarly, Adidas had no official, region-specific promotions confirmed in Southeast Asia between June 1 and June 8, 2025. Although the brand is active in other global markets, no immediate Southeast Asian product launches, discounts, or marketing events were recorded for the requested dates.

However, Adidas has two notable upcoming promotions later in June:
- A global **Mid-Year Sale** from **June 20 to June 30, 2025**, offering major markdowns across multiple product categories.
- A **30% off sale** in Singapore from **June 22 to June 25, 2025**, covering select items at participating stores and online channels.

The recent announcement of the “Sporty & Rich x Adidas Blanc” collaboration also points to a tentative June 2025 release date, though its exact start day and regional reach remain unspecified. Historically, Adidas has organized significant campaigns in early June (e.g., 6.6 Sale), but no such activity is confirmed for 2025.
