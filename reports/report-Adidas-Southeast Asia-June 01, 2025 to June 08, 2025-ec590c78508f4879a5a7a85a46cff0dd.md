*This heat map plots each row as a Southeast Asian location (Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines) and each cell as a product, labeled with its brand and product name. The color intensity of each cell corresponds to the productâ€™s discount rate, calculated as (Original Price â€“ Discounted Price) Ã· Original Price Ã— 100%. A darker shade signifies a higher discount. Observing the pattern, Anta shoes in Thailand and the Philippines provide higher discounts compared to Nike or Adidas, indicating a competitive approach to attract price-sensitive consumers. Across all locations, Adidas footwear like Ultraboost and NMD R1 generally capture moderate discounts, while Nikeâ€™s flagship models, such as the Air Jordan and ZoomX Vaporfly, exhibit slightly lower discounts, reflecting Nikeâ€™s premium pricing strategy. Overall, the heat map suggests that brands balance price competitiveness with brand value in Southeast Asia, tailoring discounts to local consumer preferences.*
