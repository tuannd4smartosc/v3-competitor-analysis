### Key Insights per Competitor
- **Nike**: Despite strong brand recognition, Nike is facing declines in overall traffic and revenue growth, particularly in Footwear. Equipment and Wellness divisions demonstrate positive momentum, suggesting diversification could offset digital sales challenges.
- **New Balance**: Strong gains in Footwear and incremental traffic growth position New Balance as an emerging leader among runners. Continued focus on community-based events and digital subscription bundles may drive further gains.
- **Fila**: Performance remains steady with moderate gains in Footwear and moderate declines in Apparel. Increased visibility in Running and Training categories can enhance Fila’s revenue share. 

By closely monitoring these division- and category-level metrics, stakeholders can refine marketing and product strategies, optimize conversion rates, and strengthen revenue performance over time.
