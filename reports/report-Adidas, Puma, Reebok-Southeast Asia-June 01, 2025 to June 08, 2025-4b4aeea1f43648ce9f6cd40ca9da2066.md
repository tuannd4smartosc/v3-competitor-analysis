# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma, Reebok in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns Analysis

### Promotion Campaigns Analysis

During the period from June 1 to June 8, 2025, there is only one publicly documented campaign from Nike and no confirmed promotional activity or events announced by Adidas, Puma, or Reebok within Southeast Asia. Below are the available details:

- **Nike**: Father’s Day Sale
  - **Exact Dates**: June 1–12, 2025 (overlaps with June 1–8)
  - **Products or Categories Involved**: Footwear, apparel, and accessories
  - **Quantitative Details**: Discounts up to 50% across a wide range of products
  - **Channel(s) of Availability**: Nike official website and participating physical stores
  - **Countries or Cities Affected**: Multiple Southeast Asian markets, as per Nike’s online storefront
  - **Type of Campaign**: Discount or voucher-based promotional campaign

For Adidas, Puma, and Reebok, there are **no reported events or campaigns** in Southeast Asia during the specified period or adjacent overlapping windows. Their most recent activities concluded in May or took place earlier in the year. Local sources and brand announcements indicate that seasonal promotions for these brands often occur around major retail events (e.g., mid-year or “6.6” sales) but no specific campaigns are documented for June 1–8, 2025.

### Additional Strategic Insights

• **Regional/Global Alignment**: While Nike’s Father’s Day Sale appears aligned with a seasonal theme, there is no evidence of a broader global synchronization. Competitors did not announce parallel “Father’s Day” discounts or large-scale campaigns in Southeast Asia during the same window.

• **Brand Overlap**: There are no indications of overlapping or co-branded campaigns among Nike, Adidas, Puma, or Reebok in early June. Each brand maintains its own independent marketing calendar, with most competitor-driven promotions concluding in May.

• **Loyalty Programs and Apps**: Nike’s app likely extends Sale offers or exclusive vouchers to members, though specific loyalty-driven perks were not reported. Adidas, Puma, and Reebok have no publicly announced loyalty or app-exclusive promotions for the stated period.

• **Country-Specific Observations**: No particularly aggressive pricing tactics or anomalies were identified. Brands appear to have paused extensive marketing activations during early June, with Nike’s Father’s Day Sale serving as the sole notable regional campaign.

This section provides an in-depth view of Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Reebok’s traffic and revenue performance across selected Southeast Asian countries during the period of June 01–08, 2025. Figures presented below are based on available data and estimated metrics (labeled as “Est.”) where specific information was not disclosed. All currency values reflect local currency (LC), and year-over-year (YoY) growth is compared to the same period in 2024. Color-coded formatting indicates performance shifts in YoY metrics:

- <span style="color:green">+X%</span> for positive growth
- <span style="color:red">–X%</span> for negative growth
- <span style="color:gray">0%</span> for no change

### Traffic Trends Overview
Recent web analytics suggest that online visits for sportswear brands across Southeast Asia continue to rise, fueled by strong interest in casual footwear, apparel, and training gear. Global data shows that Nike’s global traffic has slightly declined compared to 2024, while Adidas remains steady. Puma has demonstrated sharp traffic upswings in some markets, such as India, though specific figures in Southeast Asia remain limited. Reebok’s overall site visits worldwide are still lower than the other three, but the brand maintains modest engagement in the region.

### Revenue Performance Overview
Revenue trends indicate a mixed picture for the June 2025 period:

- **Nike**: Estimated to see mild contraction in Southeast Asia, aligning with global reports signaling a 2–4% drop in the APLA region. Lower sales in Men’s and Jordan Brand subcategories contributed to the slowdown.

- **Adidas**: Continues to register stronger sales in lifestyle and classic segments (e.g., Stan Smith, Superstar). Rough estimates point to single-digit revenue gains in Southeast Asia, supported by robust promotional campaigns.

- **Puma**: Maintains growth momentum, with estimated flat-to-slightly-positive performance across footwear and apparel lines—especially in running and football categories.

- **Reebok**: Remains a niche competitor in the region with modest sales but shows marginal gains attributable to affordable trainer lines, particularly Nano X4 Trainers.

### Key Observations
1. Even with overall market growth in Southeast Asia, Nike has shown weaker demand in certain areas (notably Men’s performance and Jordan lines), contributing to a slight revenue dip. 
2. Adidas continues to gain traction, especially in casual apparel and lifestyle categories, elevating its market share in both Singapore and Vietnam. 
3. Puma’s strongest gains remain in niche segments like Accessories and select footwear lines, highlighting targeted successes rather than broad-based growth. 
4. Reebok’s marginal improvements come from stable performance in its training categories, though its market share is still comparatively small.

Across Southeast Asia, further expansion in digital sales, direct-to-consumer models, and broader product lines are expected to shape future traffic and revenue trajectories for these four competitors. Growth opportunities in running, training, and lifestyle segments remain robust, driven by a strong consumer shift toward health, fitness, and casual sportswear preferences.
