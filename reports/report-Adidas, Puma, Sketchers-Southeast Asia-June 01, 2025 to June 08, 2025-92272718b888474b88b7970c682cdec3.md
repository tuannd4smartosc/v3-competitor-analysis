*This heat map compares discount rates (percentage off original price) for 10 products—five top-selling items per country. Rows indicate Singapore and Malaysia as the two locations; columns represent each brand–product combination. Color intensity reflects the size of the discount: darker cells indicate higher discount rates. In Singapore, Puma’s Speedcat Pro has the highest discount (40%), followed by three items at 30% off (Nike’s ZoomX Fly, Adidas’s Ultraboost 22, and Skechers’s GoRun Maxroad), and Asics’s Gel-Kayano 28 at 20%. In Malaysia, Puma’s Ignite Disc leads with a 40% discount, and four products (Nike’s Air Zoom Pegasus 40, Adidas’s Adizero Adios 6, Skechers’s D’lites 4.0, and New Balance’s Fresh Foam 1080) stand at 30% off. Higher discount rates may suggest an effort to clear inventory, attract cost-conscious buyers, or compete aggressively in the market. These trends can help retailers and analysts adjust promotional strategies or consider inventory rebalancing to optimize sales and margins.*
