# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns in Southeast Asia (June 01–08, 2025)

### Nike
No Nike promotion campaigns were announced or active in Southeast Asia between June 1 and June 8, 2025. The most recent regional promotion ended on May 11, 2025, in Singapore, and no publicly available information confirms any ongoing or upcoming Nike events in Southeast Asia for early June. Historically, Nike’s mid-season sales in the region have often occurred in May and November.

### Adidas
As of June 8, 2025, there are no officially confirmed Adidas promotions in Southeast Asia taking place exactly between June 1 and June 8. However, the following details may be relevant:
- **adiClub Days (Singapore):** Launched April 23, 2025, without a specified end date, offering member-exclusive perks, giveaways, and on-site sneaker customization. It is possible this event extended into June, though official confirmation is unavailable.
- **Global Mid-Year Sale (June 20–30, 2025):** Set to begin later in June 2025. Although specific Southeast Asia details have not been officially released, Adidas has historically aligned regional promotions with this global event.

In Southeast Asia, both Nike and Adidas typically conduct mid-season or mid-year sales around late May or late June. While no current promotions were found for the exact June 1–8 window, it is advisable to monitor brand websites and local stores for any short-notice announcements.
