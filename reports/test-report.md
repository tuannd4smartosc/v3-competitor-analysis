### 3. Data Visualization Requirements

To further enhance comparative insights across the region, each of the following tables should be designed as placeholders for multi-country, multi-brand data:

1. **Campaign Comparison Table** – Break down campaigns by country and brand, detailing distinct themes, ambassadors, and timelines.
2. **Channel Effectiveness Table** – Summarize reach, CTR, costs, and audience engagement per marketing channel (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube).
3. **Pricing Strategy Table** – Compare original vs. discount/bundle pricing, highlighting each brand’s tactics to attract value- and premium-minded consumers.
4. **Performance Metrics Table** – Provide side-by-side KPI summaries (impressions, CTR, conversions, ROI) for each major campaign.

These data visualization components can be integrated within a comprehensive dashboard or integrated into the final report appendix, enabling easy cross-reference of campaign successes and opportunities.

### 3. Data Visualization Requirements

To further enhance comparative insights across the region, each of the following tables should be designed as placeholders for multi-country, multi-brand data:

1. **Campaign Comparison Table** – Break down campaigns by country and brand, detailing distinct themes, ambassadors, and timelines.
2. **Channel Effectiveness Table** – Summarize reach, CTR, costs, and audience engagement per marketing channel (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube).
3. **Pricing Strategy Table** – Compare original vs. discount/bundle pricing, highlighting each brand’s tactics to attract value- and premium-minded consumers.
4. **Performance Metrics Table** – Provide side-by-side KPI summaries (impressions, CTR, conversions, ROI) for each major campaign.

These data visualization components can be integrated within a comprehensive dashboard or integrated into the final report appendix, enabling easy cross-reference of campaign successes and opportunities.
