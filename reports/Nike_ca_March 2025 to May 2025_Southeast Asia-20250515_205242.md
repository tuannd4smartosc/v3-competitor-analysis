## 5. Strategic Action Plan for Nike

1. **Leverage Community & Inclusivity**
   - Develop a region-specific running initiative to challenge Puma’s “everyday runner” emphasis. Incorporate local events, influencer-led group runs, and user-generated content.

2. **Enhance Localization and Cultural Relevance**
   - Collaborate with local designers and athletes in each major SEA market (e.g., a Thai-themed Air Max). This fosters cultural resonance and brand loyalty.

3. **Refine Pricing & Promotional Tactics**
   - Offer limited, strategic discounts during culturally significant periods (e.g., Eid, Songkran) to balance premium positioning with local consumer price sensitivities.

4. **Deepen Digital App Features**
   - Expand in-app membership rewards, such as tiered loyalty benefits, exclusive sneaker access, or event invitations. Build deeper data-driven personalization.

5. **Focus on Sustainable Products**
   - Introduce (and actively promote) lines like Nike Move to Zero in SEA, addressing the rising consumer interest in environmentally friendly sportswear.

By applying these strategies, Nike can reinforce its brand loyalty, counter Puma’s focus on community and inclusivity, and navigate the evolving Southeast Asian footwear market.
