# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns Analysis for Nike and Adidas in Southeast Asia (June 1–8, 2025)

### Nike Promotions
As of June 8, 2025, Nike is actively running a **Father's Day Sale** from **June 1 to June 18, 2025**. This campaign offers discounts of up to **30% off** on select styles, highlighting a range of popular products across various categories. Although specific items under this promotion have not been detailed, such campaigns typically focus on footwear and apparel most relevant to the occasion. The sale is primarily available through **Nike's online platforms** and selected **physical stores** in key Southeast Asian markets such as **Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia**.

Additionally, Nike has scheduled a **Semi-Annual Sale** from **June 15 to June 30, 2025**, which will offer discounts of up to **50%**; however, this falls outside the specified date range.

### Adidas Promotions
As of June 8, 2025, there are no officially announced promotional campaigns or events run by Adidas in Southeast Asia during the same period. However, historical patterns show that Adidas typically engages in significant promotional activities around mid-year
  - For example, the **adiClub Days** earlier this year (May 1-7, 2025) provided a **30% discount** on selected styles in Singapore.

Notably, previous campaigns from past years, such as the **6.6 Sale** in June, often feature discounts ranging up to **45%**, suggesting that Adidas could be gearing up for promotions later in June.

### Summary Table
| Brand  | Campaign/Event Name | Date(s)                | Key Products Affected | Quantitative Highlights          | Availability                            | Countries or Cities Active         |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Nike   | Father's Day Sale  | June 1 - June 18, 2025 | Selected Styles         | Up to **30% off**                  | Online, Physical Stores             | Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia    |
| Adidas | No campaigns found | N/A                    | N/A                   | N/A                                | N/A                                  | N/A                                | 

In summary, while Nike is leveraging seasonal occasions like Father's Day with relevant promotions, Adidas has not announced specific campaigns for this timeframe, indicating a lack of immediate promotional activity in Southeast Asia for early June 2025.
