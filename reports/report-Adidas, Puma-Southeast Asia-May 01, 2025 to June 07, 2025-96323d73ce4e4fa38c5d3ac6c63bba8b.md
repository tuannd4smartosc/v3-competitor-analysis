# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma in (Southeast Asia, May 01, 2025 to June 07, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns, Marketing Activations, and Events (May 01, 2025 – June 07, 2025)

### Overview
From May 1, 2025, to June 7, 2025, Nike, Adidas, and Puma conducted various promotional and marketing activities in Southeast Asia. These included discount-driven campaigns, brand partnerships, and community-focused engagements. No controversies or advocacy events were identified in the region during this period, although Nike faced unrelated backlash in London.

### Nike
Nike held region-specific promotional sales and maintained ongoing membership rewards:

- **Mid-Season Sale in Singapore (May 5–11):** Offered an additional 30% discount on over 1,500 already discounted items. Shoppers needed to purchase at least two sale items online and enter the code “GEARUP” at checkout.
- **Membership Rewards (Ongoing):** Continued to provide exclusive product previews, early access to launches, and personalized training sessions for loyalty members across Southeast Asian markets.
- **Overlap from Previous Initiatives:** Although no newly announced campaigns specifically launched in Southeast Asia during this period, Nike’s global brand app (introduced in early May) served users across Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and nearby countries.

### Adidas
Adidas pursued fresh partnerships and discount promotions targeting Southeast Asian consumers:

- **Official Partnership with Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (May 9, Philippines):** Announced as the official sportswear provider for both men’s and women’s national basketball teams, strengthening Adidas’s regional sports affiliations.
- **adiClub Member Discounts (May 1–7, Singapore):** Offered 30% discounts on more than 2,300 items exclusively for adiClub members, with automated discounts applied at online checkout.
- **LINK Expo Sale (May 2–4, Singapore):** Participated alongside Puma in a major event at Singapore Expo, featuring up to 80% discounts on selected sports products.

### Puma
Puma concentrated on deep discounts and community-oriented running campaigns:

- **5.5 Online Sale (May 4–7, Singapore):** Provided a flat 45% discount on over 500 selected products, available exclusively through Puma’s official Singapore website.
- **‘See The Run Like We Do’ Campaign (Late May, Regional):** Highlighted everyday runners’ stories and launched the Deviate NITRO 3 shoe. Activities took place in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, embracing a community-centric approach.
- **LINK Expo Sale (May 2–4, Singapore):** Joined forces with other top sports brands, offering significantly discounted items at the Singapore Expo event.

### Adjacent or Overlapping Sales
- **Original Classic Mega Sports Clearance Sale (Apr 18–May 1, Kuala Lumpur):** Although it concluded on May 1, this multi-brand clearance included promotions for Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Shoppers in Malaysia benefited from substantial price cuts, including a “Buy 1 Puma shoe, get the 2nd pair for RM1” deal.

### Additional Strategic Insights
Across their Southeast Asian efforts, all three brands appeared to emphasize:

- **Regional Alignment:** Adidas’s basketball partnership and Nike’s ongoing member rewards suggest strategic localization. Puma’s emphasis on running communities resonates with broader regional interest in communal health and wellness.
- **Overlapping Discounts:** Nike, Adidas, and Puma all leveraged mid-season or event-specific discounts, often timed with “5.5” sales or expo events, indicating a shared push for seasonal promotions.
- **Loyalty and Exclusivity:** While Nike and Adidas highlighted app-based or membership-focused perks, Puma’s community clubs and targeted campaigns aimed to deepen brand engagement.
- **Country-Specific Variations:** The Philippines saw notable sports partnerships (especially for Adidas), whereas Singapore hosted major discount events, demonstrating each market’s unique consumer preferences and brand strategies.
