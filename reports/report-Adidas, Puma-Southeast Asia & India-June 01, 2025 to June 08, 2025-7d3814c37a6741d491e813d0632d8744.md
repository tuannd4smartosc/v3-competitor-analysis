# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma in (Southeast Asia & India, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns, Marketing Activations, and Noteworthy Public Campaigns or Events

### Overview

Between June 1, 2025 and June 8, 2025, there are no publicly documented promotion campaigns, marketing activations, or major public events from Nike, Adidas, or Puma specifically targeting Southeast Asia or India. Despite each brand’s ongoing regional engagement—ranging from prior product launches to earlier partnership announcements—no direct or newly initiated campaigns within this date range have been confirmed through available sources. This absence of high-profile promotions is particularly notable given that early June often aligns with regional online sales events (such as 6.6), where brands sometimes capitalize on mid-year consumer interest.

In examining overlapping or adjacent campaigns, no announcements or leaked information suggest that campaigns which began just before June 1 continued into this timeframe for these brands. While historically each has leveraged localized promotions, influencer partnerships, and region-specific loyalty offers, no definitive activities in Southeast Asia or India for early June 2025 have been reported.

### Brand-Specific Notes

**Nike**
- No public record of new campaigns or discount promotions in Southeast Asia or India for June 1–8, 2025.
- Earlier initiatives, such as the Nike App launch and immersive running events, did not extend into this particular timeframe.
- Potential missed opportunity around 6.6 sales if no campaign was deliberately timed for that event.

**Adidas**
- No newly announced events or promotions for Southeast Asia or India during the given period.
- Previous regional partnerships (e.g., Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas) occurred before June 1, and no lasting events within the June 1–8 window were found.
- While soccer-focused marketing is prominent, no overlapping campaigns for early June were confirmed.

**Puma**
- No dedicated discount or promotional events reported for Southeast Asia or India from June 1–8.
- Earlier brand collaborations (e.g., with PV Sindhu) did not generate new campaigns within the specified timeframe.
- Significant sales and product launches are scheduled for later months (e.g., August promotions), rather than the first week of June.

### Additional Strategic Insights

Despite the absence of active campaigns in the first week of June 2025, historical data indicates that major sportswear brands often coordinate regional promotions to align with mid-year sales peaks, including 6.6 events. The lack of such promotions this year could suggest a strategic focus on:

- **Global Alignment**: With upcoming major sporting tournaments, some brands may be deferring regional pushes until later in the summer or closer to marquee events. Both Adidas and Nike, for instance, often tie campaigns to global competitions where brand visibility is heightened.

- **Loyalty and App Integration**: While no specific loyalty campaigns occurred this week, each brand has leveraged membership programs and mobile apps to deliver exclusive discounts and early product releases. Further expansions or enhancements of these platforms might launch later in the year.

- **Country-Specific Adjustments**: In some cases, a lack of early June promotions could be driven by brand strategies focusing on either Ramadan or other major regional holidays, which fell earlier in the calendar for 2025. Brands may be reevaluating whether a mid-year sale is essential or shifting resources to bigger events slated for August and beyond.

- **Brand Overlap**: There is no direct overlap in promotions from June 1–8, potentially indicating that each brand opted for smaller localized activities or chose to remain quiet ahead of launching larger, more concentrated regional campaigns in the coming months.

| **Puma**   | None Reported           | N/A     | N/A                    | N/A                     | N/A          | N/A             | N/A            |

No activities tied to Southeast Asia or India have been confirmed for the week of June 1–8, 2025. If such campaigns were in planning or under limited release, they remain undisclosed in public channels. Each brand’s historical peak promotions typically align with major sporting events or recognized sale periods (e.g., 6.6, mid-year sales, or local holiday-led promotions); the lack of advertised campaigns in this timeframe may represent a missed opportunity or a strategic choice to concentrate on later-season marketing pushes.

### Notable Insights
- In Singapore, Nike’s pageview count rose slightly while revenue showed a small decline, often driven by promotions. Adidas exhibited stable traffic with a modest revenue upturn. Puma recorded moderate gains in both traffic and revenue.
- In India, all three competitors demonstrated healthy traffic growth, with Puma outpacing others in revenue percentage gains. The training and football categories noted particularly strong uptake.
- Category-level data indicates Running and Basketball remain top drivers of traffic, while Football/Soccer is also significant in India.
- Conversion rates (CR) appear highest in performance-focused categories (e.g., Basketball), suggesting strong intent-to-purchase among niche athletes.
