# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas, Puma in (Southeast Asia & India, June 02, 2025 to June 09, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns Analysis

### Overview
During the specified period of June 2, 2025 to June 9, 2025, no active or newly announced promotion campaigns, marketing activations, or public events were identified for Nike, Adidas, or Puma in Southeast Asia and India. Publicly available data and event listings did not reveal any product launches, discount campaigns, brand collaborations, app-driven promotions, controversies, or advocacy events strictly matching the requested region and timeframe. Brands typically publish such announcements on their official websites or via social media; however, no pertinent announcements surfaced for this specific window.

Despite the lack of new information, it is worth noting that each brand often runs ongoing initiatives and seasonal promotions in these markets. In this case, however, neither official press releases nor third-party event sources indicate relevant activity in early June 2025.

### Nike
No official or unofficial campaigns were uncovered during the target period in Southeast Asia or India. Nike has previously launched global campaigns and localized efforts in these regions, often tied to major sporting events or annual retail peaks (such as mid-year or holiday sales). The absence of current promotions during early June may indicate a strategy focused on upcoming releases or sales events later in the summer, though no official details have been disclosed.

### Adidas
Similarly, no new campaigns or events were discovered for Adidas in Southeast Asia or India for the specified dates. The brand has historically capitalized on mid-year sales (e.g., “6.6” promotions) but appears not to have launched such a campaign in 2025, or at least has not publicized one. Past reporting suggests Adidas may be refining its strategies for broader, region-spanning promotions rather than short-term localized activations.

### Puma
No Puma-led or Puma-partnered campaigns emerged in the public domain for June 2–9, 2025. While Puma often pursues regional activations and product drops, none in Southeast Asia or India align with the requested timeframe. Industry analysts note Puma’s focus in 2025 on global brand awareness initiatives (e.g., “Go Wild”), which may overshadow smaller, region-specific promotions during early June.

### Additional Strategic Insights
• Given the generally high participation in “6.6” mid-year sales within Southeast Asia and India, it is unusual to see no official brand announcements. This may signal a departure from aggressive discounting or a possible shift to digital-only campaigns that have not been fully disclosed.
• All three brands typically leverage loyalty programs (Nike Membership, adiClub, and PUMA Select) to provide regional exclusives, but no such promotions were reported in Southeast Asia or India within the targeted window.
• The absence of noteworthy activity reveals possible missed opportunities for mid-year market engagement, especially as retailers and e-commerce platforms commonly run extensive promotions during early June.

Metrics cover Actual Revenue, Revenue Growth (%), Pageviews, Conversion Rates, and more. All currency figures below are estimates in local currency, labeled as (est.), reflecting available data and current exchange rates.

Despite headwinds, Nike maintained relatively strong brand recognition and stable performance in India.

### Puma Overview
Building on its prior success in India, Puma continued to see robust consumer engagement in that market, offsetting flat sales in select Southeast Asian segments. In line with 2025 Q1 data, Puma capitalized on direct-to-consumer growth but faced softness in countries like Malaysia (not shown in table) and Thailand.

### Category-Level Performance Snapshot (All Brands, Select Markets)
To capture category-specific insights, the table below aggregates Running, Basketball, and Football/Soccer across Indonesia (ID), India (IN), and Vietnam (VN). YoY changes are shown as local currency adjustments.

| Category          | Brand   | Country | Revenue (est.) | YoY Change        | AUR (est.) | Units Sold (est.) |
|-------------------|---------|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Running           | Nike    | ID      | 12.5M          | **Red -1.5%**    | 75.00     | 167,000           |
|                   | Adidas  | ID      | 11.2M          | **Green +2.1%**  | 71.50     | 156,500           |
|                   | Puma    | IN      | 10.7M          | **Green +4.8%**  | 62.00     | 172,300           |
| Basketball        | Nike    | VN      |  7.6M          | **Red -2.2%**    | 85.30     |  89,600           |
|                   | Adidas  | ID      |  5.9M          | **Green +1.0%**  | 78.25     |  75,400           |
| Football/Soccer   | Puma    | IN      | 16.3M          | **Green +3.7%**  | 68.10     | 239,000           |

- **Running**: Nike experienced a slight dip in Indonesia (–1.5%), possibly due to economic pressures, while Adidas saw moderate gains. Puma’s strong running category growth in India underscores strong local brand resonance.
- **Basketball & Football**: Nike basketball shoes declined in Vietnam, whereas Adidas saw incremental growth in Indonesia. Puma football gear continued an upward trend in India.

### Notable Observations (June 02–09, 2025)
1. **India Outperforms**: Both Puma and Adidas posted above-average gains in India, driven by robust direct-to-consumer strategies and heightened brand visibility.
2. **Singapore Stays Competitive**: Nike and Puma observed modest revenue improvements in niche divisions, although overall market share remains fragmented.
3. **Mixed Traffic Results**: While pageviews generally grew across some verticals, conversion rates varied markedly among categories, suggesting potential optimization in site design or product presentation.
4. **Pricing & Inventory**: Minor revenue dips in apparel for certain markets (e.g., Indonesia for Nike) could indicate pricing sensitivity and the importance of localized assortments.

Throughout Southeast Asia and India, the June 02–09, 2025 period highlights diverging patterns in traffic, orders, and revenue. Brands that tailor product lines to local tastes—particularly in running and women’s performance—appear well-positioned to capitalize on regional growth opportunities.
