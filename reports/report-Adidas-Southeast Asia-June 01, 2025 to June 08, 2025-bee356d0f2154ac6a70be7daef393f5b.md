# Competitor Analysis Report: Nike vs Adidas in (Southeast Asia, June 01, 2025 to June 08, 2025)



## Promotion Campaigns, Marketing Activations, and Noteworthy Public Events (June 01 – June 08, 2025)

### Overview
During the period from June 1 to June 8, 2025, neither Nike nor Adidas announced or conducted any new, brand-specific campaigns, product launches, or events strictly within Southeast Asia. Although no mid-week or end-of-week promotions for Nike were noted, Adidas did offer discount promotions in Singapore and Vietnam that ended within this timeframe, overlapping slightly with the requested period:

- In Singapore, a 15% sitewide discount ended on June 7, 2025. This initiative included footwear, apparel, and accessories, accessible through the Adidas website. The sale was primarily promotional, offering percentage-based discounts.
- In Vietnam, an outlet sale with up to 50% off concluded on June 5, 2025. This sale spanned multiple product categories, including footwear, clothing, and accessories, and was available in Adidas factory outlets.

For Nike, there were no regional marketing activations, discount or voucher campaigns, brand collaborations, public events, or advocacy-related activities in Southeast Asia that specifically fell into, or extended through, the June 1 to June 8, 2025 window. Nike’s prior promotions and in-store events ended by mid-May 2025.

### Additional Strategic Insights
Despite the absence of active promotions by Nike in Southeast Asia during the specified dates, Adidas briefly ran overlapping discount campaigns. This slight extension into early June aligns with typical mid-year sales seasons (e.g., 6.6 discount windows). No notable parallel efforts, collaborations, or direct pricing competition between Nike and Adidas emerged for these exact dates. Both brands continue to leverage digital channels and loyalty apps for broader engagement, but no specific new loyalty campaigns or deeply discounted offers were found.

From a strategic perspective:
- Nike’s apparent focus on reducing reliance on promotional discounts, as previously reported, may explain the absence of new offers in early June.
- Adidas concluded multiple sales just before or during the first week of June, suggesting a short, region-specific push aligned with regional “6.6” style sales.
- Neither brand demonstrated country-specific anomalies or particularly aggressive pricing tactics during this period, indicating normal promotional flows rather than reactive pricing battles.
- No controversies, advocacy events, or brand-specific social impact initiatives surfaced in Southeast Asia during the stated window, possibly reflecting a calm period for both brands post-May promotions.

### Summary Table

| Brand  | Campaign/Event Name      | Date(s)             | Key Products Affected           | Quantitative Highlights           | Channel(s)      | Countries/Cities         | Type         |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Adidas | 15% Sitewide Discount   | Until June 7, 2025  | Footwear, Apparel, Accessories  | 15% off Storewide                 | Website         | Singapore                | Promotional |
| Adidas | Outlet Sale (Up to 50%) | Until June 5, 2025  | Footwear, Clothing, Accessories | Up to 50% off Selected Items       | Physical Outlets| Vietnam                  | Promotional |
| Nike   | None                    | N/A                  | N/A                             | N/A                                | N/A             | N/A                      | N/A         |

No Nike campaigns or events were identified during June 1–8, 2025, in Southeast Asia. Given Nike’s shift in global strategy toward fewer promotions and more brand-building initiatives, the lack of announcements during this period may represent a missed opportunity or simply an intentional pullback from traditional discount-led activities. Adidas concluded relevant discounts shortly before or during this window, with no official announcements of extended or new promotions beginning after June 7.
